# HorseLamenessTracker

Uses OpenCV to delect acute lameness in horses using existing cheap hardware. This is currently a work in progress, my original project that I submitted didn't include the QT library and used OpenCV's highgui instead and gnuplot as to generate the graphs, while this project might still use gnuplot I am planning to move towards QGraph instead.

### Prerequisites

Some knowledge of QT and OpenCV, this project is done in QT creator. Knowledge of how to link OpenCV 3 to QT.

### Installing

Download as a zip and open the project in QT creator, I built and ran this project with the MSVC2019 compiler rather than MinGW because I already had OpenCV 3 setup with visual studio and this was just quicker.

## Running the tests

There are no tests for this prototype
